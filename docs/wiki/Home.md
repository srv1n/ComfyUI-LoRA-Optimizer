# LoRA Optimizer Wiki

A ComfyUI node suite that **automatically analyzes your LoRA stack** and selects heuristic merge strategies per weight group. Instead of blindly stacking LoRAs (which causes oversaturation and sign conflicts), the optimizer examines where LoRAs overlap, how much they conflict, how aligned their subspaces are, and picks a local approach for each region independently.

---

## Quick Start

1. Add a **LoRA Stack** (or **LoRA Stack (Dynamic)**) node
2. Select your LoRAs and set strengths
3. Connect to **LoRA Optimizer** (or the Advanced variant)
4. Connect `MODEL` and optionally `CLIP` from your checkpoint loader
5. Use the optimizer's `MODEL`/`CLIP` outputs for sampling

The optimizer handles everything automatically — conflict analysis, strategy selection, and merge execution. Connect the `STRING` output to a **Show Text** node to see the full analysis report.

## At a Glance

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Per-prefix adaptive merge** | Each weight group gets its own strategy based on local conflict data |
| **5 merge algorithms** | Weighted sum, weighted average, TIES, SLERP, consensus |
| **Sparsification** | DARE and DELLA with standard and conflict-aware variants |
| **3 quality levels** | Standard, enhanced (DO + column-wise + TALL-masks), maximum (+ KnOTS SVD) |
| **Auto-strength** | Interference-aware energy normalization prevents oversaturation |
| **Architecture presets** | Tuned thresholds for UNet, DiT, and LLM architectures |
| **Key normalization** | Mix LoRAs from any trainer (Kohya, AI-Toolkit, LyCORIS, diffusers, etc.) |
| **SVD compression** | Re-compress merged patches to low-rank for ~32x RAM savings |
| **AutoTuner** | Sweep 2,000+ parameter combinations and rank them by internal metrics or an external evaluator |
| **Low memory** | Two-pass streaming architecture — peak memory scales with the largest active target group, not the full stack |
| **6 architectures** | FLUX, SDXL, Z-Image, Wan, LTX Video, Qwen-Image |

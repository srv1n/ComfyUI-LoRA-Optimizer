A ComfyUI node suite that **automatically analyzes your LoRA stack** and selects a heuristic merge strategy per weight group — diff-based merging, excess-conflict + subspace-aware analysis, DARE/DELLA sparsification, per-group adaptive decisions with optional block smoothing, exact low-rank linear merges, architecture-aware key normalization, optional activation-aware calibration, enhanced merge quality (KnOTS-inspired alignment, column-wise voting, TALL-inspired mask protection), and auto-tuned parameters. Core nodes: **LoRA Stack** (build input), **LoRA Optimizer** (analyze + merge), and **LoRA AutoTuner** (sweep parameter combinations and rank configs by merge proxies or an external evaluator hook).

## Nodes

### LoRA Stack

Builds a list of LoRAs for the optimizer. Chain multiple Stack nodes to add any number of LoRAs.

**Inputs:** LoRA selector, strength, conflict_mode, key_filter, optional previous `LORA_STACK`

**Outputs:** `LORA_STACK`

---

### LoRA Stack (Dynamic)

Single node with adjustable slot count (1–10) — replaces chaining multiple Stack nodes.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Simple** | One `strength` slider per LoRA — clean and beginner-friendly |
| **Advanced** | Separate `model_strength` and `clip_strength`, plus `conflict_mode` and `key_filter` per LoRA |

Accepts an optional `lora_stack` input to chain with other Stack nodes.

**Outputs:** `LORA_STACK`

---

### LoRA Optimizer

The auto-optimizer. Takes a `LORA_STACK`, analyzes the LoRAs, and automatically selects merge modes and parameters **per weight group** using local conflict heuristics. Outputs the merged result plus a detailed analysis report with a block strategy map. Available in two variants:

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **LoRA Optimizer** (Simple) | Sensible defaults — just model, stack, output strength, and optional CLIP. Auto-strength enabled. |
| **LoRA Optimizer (Advanced)** | Full control — sparsification, merge quality, SVD device, key normalization, and all other knobs. |

Also accepts standard tuple-format stacks `(lora_name, model_strength, clip_strength)` from Efficiency Nodes, Comfyroll, and similar packs.

Uses a **two-pass streaming architecture** for low memory usage:
- **Pass 1 (Analysis):** Resolves trainer aliases to target weights, aggregates alias collisions per LoRA, samples conflict and magnitude statistics per target group, then discards the diffs. Only lightweight scalars are kept.
- **Pass 2 (Merge):** Recomputes diffs per target group, looks up that group's conflict data, picks a strategy for it, and merges. Each group is freed after merging. Standard linear merges stay in exact low-rank form; nonlinear merges and optional compression still use dense/SVD paths.

Peak memory is still roughly “one target group at a time,” but the exact peak depends on the largest layer, how many LoRAs hit it, and whether extra quality/compression steps are enabled. GPU-accelerated on both passes.

<details>
<summary><b>What It Analyzes</b></summary>

- Per-LoRA metrics (rank, key count, effective L2 norms)
- Pairwise raw + magnitude-weighted conflict ratios per target group (sampled for efficiency)
- Excess conflict over the cosine baseline, plus low-rank subspace overlap
- Pairwise cosine similarity (directional alignment between LoRAs)
- Magnitude / activation-importance distribution per target group
- Key overlap between LoRAs

</details>

#### Per-Group Adaptive Merge

The key insight: two LoRAs may overlap in some model blocks but not others. A face LoRA and a style LoRA might only conflict in attention layers 4-7, while the rest of the model is touched by only one of them.

Instead of picking one global strategy (which either wastes TIES trimming on non-overlapping blocks or misses real conflicts), the optimizer decides **per resolved target group**:

<div align="center">

| Condition | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Only 1 LoRA touches this group | `weighted_sum` — full strength, no dilution |
| 2+ LoRAs, low excess conflict + low subspace overlap | `weighted_average` — mostly independent updates |
| 2+ LoRAs, high similarity + low excess conflict | `consensus` — aligned, low-interference merge |
| 2+ LoRAs, excess conflict > 25% with overlapping subspaces | `ties` — resolve real conflicts with trim/elect/merge |
| Magnitude ratio > 2x in the group | `total` sign method (stronger LoRA dominates) |
| Magnitude ratio <= 2x in the group | `frequency` sign method (equal votes) |

</div>

This means non-overlapping regions keep 100% of their LoRA's effect, while genuinely conflicting regions get proper TIES resolution. When `decision_smoothing > 0`, those per-group metrics are softly pulled toward the block average so adjacent layers do not flip strategies due to noisy samples.

<p align="center"><a href="assets/merge-strategies.png"><img src="assets/merge-strategies.svg" alt="Merge Strategies Comparison" width="100%"></a></p>

<details>
<summary><b>TIES Merging</b></summary>

The optimizer automatically selects TIES-Merging (Trim, Elect Sign, Disjoint Merge — [Yadav et al., NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01708)) on prefixes where sign conflicts are detected between LoRAs.

<p align="center"><a href="assets/ties-diagram.png"><img src="assets/ties-diagram.svg" alt="TIES Merging Pipeline" width="100%"></a></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>DARE / DELLA Sparsification</b></summary>

DARE and DELLA **sparsify each LoRA's diff before merging**, reducing parameter interference between LoRAs. The implementations here are practical LoRA-oriented variants inspired by those papers, not paper-faithful reproductions. Available in two modes: **standard** (drops weights everywhere) and **conflict-aware** (only drops weights where LoRAs actually interfere).

<p align="center"><a href="assets/sparsification-diagram.png"><img src="assets/sparsification-diagram.svg" alt="DARE / DELLA Sparsification" width="100%"></a></p>

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|-------------|
| **DARE** | Bernoulli random mask at given density. Survivors rescaled by 1/density to preserve expected value. Fast and unbiased. |
| **DELLA** | Per-row magnitude ranking. Low-magnitude elements get higher drop probability, high-magnitude elements are kept. More surgical than DARE. |
| **DARE (conflict-aware)** | Same as DARE, but only applied at positions where 2+ LoRAs push in **opposite directions**. Same-sign positions (where LoRAs reinforce each other) are left untouched. |
| **DELLA (conflict-aware)** | Same as DELLA, but only at conflict positions. Unique contributions from each LoRA are fully preserved. |

**Why conflict-aware?** Standard sparsification drops weights everywhere — including positions where only one LoRA contributes, or where multiple LoRAs agree. This destroys useful signal. Conflict-aware variants compute a **sign-conflict mask** first: positions where LoRAs push in opposite directions (actual interference). Only those positions get sparsified. The result: interference is reduced without sacrificing unique features.

**Interaction with merge strategies:**
- **TIES mode:** DARE/DELLA *replaces* the TIES trim step (both achieve sparsification, no need for both)
- **Other modes:** Applied as preprocessing before the merge operation

| Setting | Default | Options |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `sparsification` | disabled | `disabled`, `dare`, `della`, `dare_conflict`, `della_conflict` |
| `sparsification_density` | 0.7 | Fraction of parameters to keep (lower = more aggressive) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Merge Quality (Enhanced / Maximum)</b></summary>

Three quality levels for merge conflict resolution, selectable via the `merge_quality` dropdown:

<p align="center"><a href="assets/merge-quality-diagram.png"><img src="assets/merge-quality-diagram.svg" alt="Merge Quality Pipeline" width="100%"></a></p>

| Level | What It Adds | Cost |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **standard** (default) | Current behavior — element-wise sign voting and merge | Baseline |
| **enhanced** | Column-wise conflict resolution + TALL-inspired selfish weight protection | Minimal extra compute, no extra VRAM |
| **maximum** | KnOTS-inspired SVD alignment + column-wise + TALL-inspired masks | More VRAM for SVD decomposition |

**Column-wise conflict resolution** (enhanced+): Instead of each weight position voting independently on sign direction, entire output neurons (rows) vote as a unit. This preserves structural coherence — a neuron's weights work together, so their signs should be resolved together.

**TALL-masks** (enhanced+): A practical dominance-mask heuristic inspired by TALL. It identifies "selfish" weights — positions where one LoRA dominates and others contribute little. These weights are separated from the consensus merge and added back afterward, protecting each LoRA's unique features from being averaged away.

**KnOTS SVD alignment** (maximum): A practical SVD alignment step inspired by KnOTS. It projects LoRA diffs into a shared singular value basis before merging so the representations are more directly comparable. Falls back to CPU on GPU OOM, skips gracefully if both fail.

**Interaction with other settings:**
- Works with all merge modes (TIES, weighted_average, SLERP, etc.)
- Combines with DARE/DELLA sparsification — sparsification runs first, then quality enhancements
- Best combination: `maximum` + `della_conflict` (or `dare_conflict`) for full pipeline
- Single-LoRA prefixes: all enhancements short-circuit (no work to do)

| Setting | Default | Options |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `merge_quality` | standard | `standard`, `enhanced`, `maximum` |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Key Filter</b></summary>

<a name="key-filter"></a>

Each LoRA has a per-LoRA `key_filter` setting (available on both **LoRA Stack** and **LoRA Stack (Dynamic)** in advanced mode) that controls which target groups that LoRA contributes to, based on how many LoRAs in the stack share each resolved target:

| Filter | Behavior | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `all` (default) | Contribute to all keys | Normal merging |
| `shared_only` | Only contribute to keys present in 2+ LoRAs | Strip variant-specific keys (I2V/VACE) from this LoRA |
| `unique_only` | Only contribute to keys present in exactly 1 LoRA | Extract only the variant-specific adapter keys from this LoRA |

This is especially useful for Wan T2V/I2V/VACE LoRAs, which share ~90% of weights but each variant has unique keys (I2V: `cross_attn.k_img/v_img`, `img_emb`; VACE: `vace_blocks.*`, `vace_patch_embedding`).

Because the filter is per-LoRA, you can apply different filters to different LoRAs in the same stack — e.g., "take only the unique VACE keys from LoRA #2 while merging all keys from LoRA #1".

**Example — making an I2V LoRA T2V-compatible:**
1. Stack a T2V LoRA + an I2V LoRA together
2. Set the I2V LoRA's `key_filter` to `shared_only`
3. The I2V-only keys (`k_img`, `v_img`, `img_emb`, etc.) are skipped for that LoRA since they appear in only 1 LoRA
4. The merged result contains only the shared T2V-compatible weights

**Example — extracting a lightweight I2V adapter:**
1. Same stack (T2V + I2V)
2. Set the I2V LoRA's `key_filter` to `unique_only`
3. Only the I2V-specific keys are contributed by that LoRA — a small adapter with just the variant-specific weights

The filter uses the raw `n_loras` count from Pass 1 (before any filtering) and now participates in analysis as well as Pass 2 merge.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Auto-Strength</b></summary>

When `auto_strength` is set to `enabled`, the optimizer automatically reduces per-LoRA strengths before merging to prevent overexposure from stacking. This is especially useful on distilled/turbo models where 2+ LoRAs at full strength cause blown-out results even with strong merge settings.

The algorithm uses **interference-aware energy normalization**: during Pass 1 it streams exact Frobenius norms and pairwise dots for each LoRA branch, then computes the exact vector-sum energy separately for model and CLIP updates. All strengths are uniformly scaled so the total combined energy matches what the strongest single LoRA would contribute alone.

- **Aligned LoRAs** (cos~1) — stronger reduction (they reinforce each other, so combined energy is high)
- **Orthogonal LoRAs** (cos~0) — moderate reduction, optionally clamped by an architecture-aware floor
- **Opposing LoRAs** (cos~-1) — minimal reduction (they cancel out, so combined energy is low)

When orthogonal LoRAs are effectively independent, the optimizer can clamp the scale factor with `auto_strength_floor`:

| Architecture | Default floor |
|-------------|---------------|
| Wan / LTX Video | 1.0 |
| SD / SDXL / Flux / Z-Image | 0.85 |
| LLM-style presets | 0.9 |

`auto_strength_floor = -1` uses the architecture default. Setting `0.0–1.0` overrides it manually.

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 2 aligned LoRAs (cos~1) at strength 1.0 | Each reduced to ~0.50 |
| 2 orthogonal LoRAs (cos~0) at strength 1.0 | Each reduced to ~0.71 before floor-clamping |
| 2 opposing LoRAs (cos~-1) at strength 1.0 | ~1.0 each (they cancel) |
| 1 strong + 1 weak LoRA | Proportional reduction |
| Single LoRA | No change |
| `auto_strength` disabled | No adjustment (default) |

Your original strength ratios are always preserved — the algorithm only scales them down uniformly.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Calibration & Smoothing</b></summary>

Two optional advanced inputs push the optimizer beyond raw weight-space heuristics:

- **`decision_smoothing`** — blends each group's decision metrics toward the average of its surrounding block. This reduces jagged layer-to-layer mode flips when the stack is noisy.
- **`calibration_data`** — supplies per-target input statistics so importance can be measured with activation-aware energy, not just Frobenius norm. The expected JSON schema is:

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "target.key": {
      "input_diag": [1.0, 0.8, 0.2]
    }
  },
  "default": {
    "scale": 1.0
  }
}
```

`input_diag` is the preferred form. `channel_diag` and scalar `scale`/`input_trace` fallbacks are also supported.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Architecture-Aware Key Normalization</b></summary>

Different LoRA trainers (Kohya, AI-Toolkit, LyCORIS, diffusers/PEFT) produce LoRAs with **different key naming conventions** for the same model weights. When mixing LoRAs from different trainers, the optimizer sees no key overlap and cannot merge them correctly.

Key normalization auto-detects the model architecture from LoRA key patterns and remaps all keys to a canonical format, enabling correct overlap detection and conflict analysis across trainer formats.

<p align="center"><a href="assets/key-normalization.png"><img src="assets/key-normalization.svg" alt="Architecture-Aware Key Normalization" width="100%"></a></p>

| Architecture | Detected From | Normalization |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Z-Image** (Lumina2) | `diffusion_model.layers.N.attention`, `single_transformer_blocks` | Prefix standardization, QKV split for per-component analysis, re-fuse after merge |
| **FLUX** | `double_blocks`/`single_blocks`, `transformer.transformer_blocks` | AI-Toolkit / Kohya / diffusers unified to canonical format |
| **Wan** 2.1/2.2 | `blocks.N` with `self_attn`/`cross_attn`/`ffn` | LyCORIS / diffusers / Musubi Tuner unified, RS-LoRA alpha fix |
| **SDXL** | `lora_te1_`/`lora_te2_`, `input_blocks`/`down_blocks` | Text encoder + UNet key unification |
| **LTX Video** | `adaln_single`, `transformer_blocks` with `attn1`/`attn2` | Trainer format unification |
| **ACE-Step** | `layers.N` with `self_attn`/`cross_attn` and `q_proj`/`k_proj`/`v_proj` | Attention key unification |
| **Qwen-Image** | `transformer_blocks` with `img_mlp`/`txt_mlp`/`img_mod`/`txt_mod` | Dual-stream key unification |

**Z-Image QKV handling:** Z-Image LoRAs often fuse Q, K, V projections into a single `attention.qkv` weight. The normalizer splits these into separate `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` components for per-component conflict analysis, then **re-fuses** them back to the native format after merging.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `normalize_keys` | enabled | `disabled` or `enabled`. Recommended for mixed-trainer stacks and required for Z-Image QKV fusion. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Architecture-Aware Behavior Profiles</b></summary>

All numeric thresholds in the optimizer (density estimation, conflict detection, auto-strength scaling, scoring heuristics) are tuned per architecture family. The `architecture_preset` setting selects the appropriate thresholds — `auto` detects from LoRA key patterns.

| Preset | Architectures | Key Differences | Orthogonal floor |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| `sd_unet` | SD 1.5, SDXL | Density range [0.1, 0.9], noise floor 10%, max strength cap 3.0 | 0.85 |
| `dit` | Flux, WAN, Z-Image, LTX, HunyuanVideo | Density range [0.4, 0.95], noise floor 5%, max strength cap 5.0 | 0.85 by default, 1.0 for Wan/LTX |
| `llm` | Qwen-Image, LLaMA-based | Density range [0.1, 0.8], noise floor 15%, max strength cap 3.0 | 0.9 |

**Why it matters:** DiT architectures have denser weight distributions than UNet — with UNet thresholds, the optimizer underestimates density and clips suggested strength too aggressively. LLM-based models are sparser and benefit from lower density ceilings.

| Setting | Default | Options |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `architecture_preset` | auto | `auto`, `sd_unet`, `dit`, `llm`. Auto-detection uses the same key pattern matching as key normalization |

**Note:** This is orthogonal to `behavior_profile` (which controls *strategy features* like consensus mode and SLERP upgrade). Architecture preset controls the *numeric thresholds* those strategies use.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>SVD Patch Compression</b></summary>

After merging, full-rank diff patches consume ~128x more RAM than standard LoRA patches (64MB vs 0.5MB per key for a 4096x4096 weight). The optimizer re-compresses merged patches to low-rank via truncated SVD, dramatically reducing post-merge RAM.

| Mode | What gets compressed | Quality | RAM savings |
|------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `non_ties` (default) | Standard linear merges (`weighted_sum`, `weighted_average`) plus any other non-TIES diff patches | Exact for standard linear low-rank merges; approximate when a dense/SVD path is still required | ~32x on compressed patches |
| `all` | Everything including TIES | Lossy on nonlinear prefixes — trim, sign election, masking, or dense cleanup steps can produce full-rank results that can't be perfectly captured | ~32x on all prefixes |
| `disabled` | Nothing | No loss | No savings |

When dense compression is needed, the compression rank is automatically computed as the sum of all input LoRA ranks. For example, 3 rank-32 LoRAs produce a rank-96 compressed patch — enough to represent the full merge on linear operations when no extra nonlinear processing is involved.

> **Tip:** For video models (LTX, Wan, etc.) with high RAM usage, use `weighted_sum_only` + `non_ties` (or `all`). Standard linear patches stay exact in low-rank form; dense/nonlinear patches still use recompression.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Optimization Modes</b></summary>

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `per_prefix` (default) | Each weight group picks its own strategy based on local conflict data |
| `global` | Single strategy for all prefixes (original behavior) |
| `weighted_sum_only` | Forces simple weighted sum everywhere — no TIES, no averaging. Combined with patch compression, all patches are fully compressible with zero quality loss |

<summary><b>Important notes & limitations</b></summary>

> **Structural & Edit LoRAs:** Do not put distillation LoRAs (LCM, Lightning, Turbo, Hyper), DPO LoRAs, or **edit model LoRAs** (Qwen edit, Klein edit, instruction-editing LoRAs) in the optimizer stack. These LoRAs modify the model's fundamental behavior — their weights are precisely calibrated and merging them with style LoRAs can break their training. Apply them via a standard **Load LoRA** node upstream, then feed only your style/character LoRAs into the optimizer. If you must include an edit LoRA in the stack, use `weighted_sum_only` mode and disable sparsification to avoid weight trimming.

> **Limitation:** The optimizer only analyzes LoRAs in its own stack. It cannot see LoRA patches applied by upstream nodes (Load LoRA, etc.) — those stack additively on top of the optimizer's output. Fully baked merges (safetensors checkpoints) are indistinguishable from base weights and cannot be detected.

### LoRA AutoTuner

Automatically sweeps all merge parameters (mode, sparsification, density, dampening, quality level) and ranks configurations for your LoRA stack. Runs Pass 1 analysis once, scores all parameter combinations via heuristic proxies, then merges the top-N candidates and measures output quality. When `calibration_data` is connected, measured scoring becomes activation-aware. When an `AUTOTUNER_EVALUATOR` is connected, the built-in score can be blended with external prompt/reference evaluation logic. Outputs the highest-ranked merge directly as `MODEL`/`CLIP`, plus a ranked report and `TUNER_DATA` for exploring alternatives via a **Merge Selector** node.

**Inputs:** `MODEL`, `LORA_STACK`, output strength, optional `CLIP`, top_n, normalize_keys, scoring_svd, scoring_device, scoring_speed, architecture_preset, auto strength floor, output mode, `decision_smoothing`, optional `calibration_data`, optional `evaluator`, diff_cache_mode, diff_cache_ram_pct, cache_patches, record_dataset, vram_budget.

**Outputs:** `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `STRING` (ranked report), `STRING` (analysis report), `TUNER_DATA` (for Merge Selector / Save Tuner Data), `LORA_DATA` (for Save Merged LoRA)

<details>
<summary><b>Diff Cache</b></summary>

During the parameter sweep, each candidate recomputes raw LoRA diffs (A@B matmul) from scratch — even though diffs depend only on LoRA content, not merge config. The diff cache stores these diffs after the first candidate and reuses them for subsequent candidates, eliminating redundant computation.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `disabled` (default) | Recomputes diffs each time. No extra memory |
| `auto` | Uses RAM up to `diff_cache_ram_pct` of free memory, then spills to disk. Recommended for most setups |
| `ram` | All diffs in RAM. Fastest, but uses ~1.5 GB (SDXL) to ~6 GB (Flux) |
| `disk` | All diffs to temp files with memory-mapping. Slowest cache mode, but minimal RAM |

When `auto` mode runs out of disk space, it falls back to RAM automatically.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `diff_cache_mode` | auto | Cache mode selection |
| `diff_cache_ram_pct` | 0.5 | Fraction of free system RAM for `auto` mode (0.1–0.9) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Output Mode</b></summary>

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `merge` (default) | Full sweep + final merge — outputs the top-ranked merged model |
| `tuning_only` | Full sweep but skips the final merge — outputs the base model unchanged so a downstream optimizer can apply the winning config |

When cache is enabled, switching between modes reuses the same sweep results.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>VRAM Budget</b></summary>

The `vram_budget` slider (0.0–1.0) controls what fraction of free VRAM to use for storing merged patches on GPU. Default is 0 (all patches on CPU). Setting it higher keeps patches on GPU, reducing RAM usage on systems with enough VRAM. Available on both LoRA Optimizer and LoRA AutoTuner.

</details>

---

### Merge Selector

Applies a specific configuration from AutoTuner results without re-running the sweep. Connect `TUNER_DATA` from a LoRA AutoTuner (or Load Tuner Data) node and set the `selection` index to choose which ranked configuration to apply (1 = top-ranked, 2 = next-ranked, etc.).

**Inputs:** `MODEL`, `LORA_STACK`, `TUNER_DATA`, selection (1–10), output strength, optional `CLIP`, optional clip strength multiplier, optional auto strength floor, optional `decision_smoothing`, optional `calibration_data`, vram_budget.

**Outputs:** `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `STRING` (report), `LORA_DATA`

**Workflow:**
```
LoRA AutoTuner → TUNER_DATA → Merge Selector (selection=2) → try the 2nd-ranked config
                      ↓
              Save Tuner Data → (reload later) → Load Tuner Data → Merge Selector
```

---

### AutoTuner → Optimizer Bridge

Chain the AutoTuner and Optimizer in a single model line for a “rank, then tweak” workflow. Only one node merges at a time — the other passes the model through. A single switch controls which node is authoritative, and the UI bridge keeps the paired widgets in sync.

<p align="center">
  <a href="assets/bridge-workflow.png"><img src="assets/bridge-workflow.svg" alt="AutoTuner ↔ Optimizer Bridge workflow" width="700"></a>
</p>

```
[Load Model] → [AutoTuner] → model → [Optimizer] → MODEL → sampler
[LoRA Stack]  → [AutoTuner]
[LoRA Stack]  → [Optimizer]
               [AutoTuner] → tuner_data → [Optimizer]
```

| Optimizer `settings_source` | AutoTuner `output_mode` | What happens |
|----|----|----|
| `from_autotuner` | `merge` (auto-synced) | AutoTuner merges → Optimizer passes through. Optimizer widgets show the winning config. |
| `manual` | `tuning_only` (auto-synced) | AutoTuner passes the base model through → Optimizer merges with its own widget settings. |

**Typical flow:**
1. Start with `from_autotuner` to let the AutoTuner rank configs and apply the top result.
2. Inspect the Optimizer widgets to see which settings won.
3. Switch to `manual` to keep the winning settings as a starting point and continue tweaking locally.

<details>
<summary><b>Save / Load Tuner Data</b></summary>

Two utility nodes for persisting AutoTuner results to disk:

**Save Tuner Data** — Saves `TUNER_DATA` as a JSON file under `models/tuner_data/`. Subdirectories are allowed; path traversal outside that folder is blocked. `OUTPUT_NODE = True`.

**Load Tuner Data** — Dropdown of saved tuner data files. Outputs `TUNER_DATA` ready for Merge Selector. Auto-reloads when the file changes on disk.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Calibration / Evaluator Utilities</b></summary>

Three utility nodes support the new activation-aware and prompt/reference-aware paths:

- **Build AutoTuner Python Evaluator** — packages a Python module path + callable name into an `AUTOTUNER_EVALUATOR` object. The callable can run prompts, compare references, and return a score in `[0, 1]`.
- **Save Calibration Data** — writes `CALIBRATION_DATA` JSON under `models/lora_calibration_data/`. Subdirectories are allowed; traversal outside that folder is blocked.
- **Load Calibration Data** — loads that JSON back into `CALIBRATION_DATA`.

The evaluator callable receives keyword arguments: `model`, `clip`, `lora_data`, `config`, `context`, and `analysis_summary`.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><b>Save Merged LoRA</b></summary>

Saves the optimizer's merged result as a standalone `.safetensors` file that works with any standard LoRA loader.

Connect the `LORA_DATA` output from LoRA Optimizer to this node.

| Option | Default | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `save_folder` | first configured LoRA folder | Choose which configured ComfyUI LoRA directory to save into |
| `filename` | `merged_lora` | File name relative to `save_folder`. Subdirectories are allowed (e.g. `merged/my_lora`) |
| `save_rank` | 0 (auto) | 0 = use each layer's existing rank from the merge. Non-zero = force this rank for layers that need compression |
| `bake_strength` | enabled | When on, the saved LoRA reproduces your exact merge at strength 1.0. When off, strengths are not baked in |

**Outputs:** `STRING` (file path)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Merged LoRA to Hook</b></summary>

Wraps the optimizer's merged patches as a **conditioning hook** (`HOOKS`) for per-conditioning LoRA application. Instead of applying the merged LoRA globally to the model, you can attach it to specific conditioning entries using ComfyUI's hook system.

Connect the `LORA_DATA` output from LoRA Optimizer to this node, then connect the `HOOKS` output to a **Cond Set Props** (or similar) node.

**Inputs:** `LORA_DATA` (required), `HOOKS` (optional — chain with existing hooks)

**Outputs:** `HOOKS`

Use this node when you want the merged LoRA to apply **only to specific conditioning** rather than the entire model:

- **Per-prompt LoRA:** Apply different merged LoRAs to positive vs negative conditioning
- **Scheduled application:** Combine with hook keyframes to apply the LoRA only during certain sampling steps
- **Regional conditioning:** Use with area-based conditioning to apply the LoRA to specific image regions
- **Preserving the base model:** Keep the MODEL output clean (unpatched) while still using the merged LoRA through conditioning hooks

**Workflow example:**
```
Load Checkpoint → MODEL ──┬──→ LoRA Optimizer → LORA_DATA → Merged LoRA to Hook → HOOKS
                           │                                                          ↓
                           └──→ KSampler ←──── Conditioning ←──── Cond Set Props
```

The `prev_hooks` input allows chaining multiple hook sources together.

<details>
<summary><b>WanVideo LoRA Optimizer</b></summary>

Variant of the LoRA Optimizer for **WanVideo models** (via [kijai's WanVideoWrapper](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper)). Accepts `WANVIDEOMODEL` instead of `MODEL`, skips CLIP, and applies merged patches in-memory.

All merging algorithms are inherited — TIES, DARE/DELLA, SVD compression, auto-strength, per-group adaptive merge, merge quality enhancements (KnOTS-inspired alignment, column-wise voting, TALL-inspired masks), and Wan key normalization (LyCORIS/diffusers/Fun LoRA/finetrainer/RS-LoRA naming support) all work identically.

**Inputs:** `WANVIDEOMODEL`, `LORA_STACK`, output strength, and all optimizer options (except CLIP-related ones). Defaults: `normalize_keys=enabled`, `cache_patches=disabled`.

**Outputs:** `WANVIDEOMODEL` (patched), `STRING` (analysis report), `LORA_DATA` (for Save Merged LoRA)

**Basic workflow:**
```
WanVideoModelLoader → WANVIDEOMODEL → WanVideo LoRA Optimizer → WANVIDEOMODEL → WanVideoSampler
                                               ↑
                        LoRA Stack ─────────────┘
```

**Chaining with individual LoRAs:** Individual (non-merged) LoRAs go through WanVideoLoraSelect → model loader as usual. Our optimizer applies merged LoRAs on top — both coexist in the model patcher.

```
WanVideoLoraSelect → WanVideoModelLoader → WANVIDEOMODEL → WanVideo LoRA Optimizer → Sampler
                                                                    ↑
                                             LoRA Stack ────────────┘
```

**Key defaults differ from the standard optimizer:**
- `normalize_keys` = **enabled** — WanVideo LoRAs come from many trainers, normalization is commonly needed
- `cache_patches` = **disabled** — video models are large, caching uses significant RAM
- `architecture_preset` = **dit** — DiT-tuned thresholds (higher density floor, wider strength range)
